This simulation on swarm attack within 2 beehives, The queen is the most potent to damages, The Warrior has good attackability, The Worker is like a pawn. Bees move in the direction of their prey with random velocities. With each hit, the health of enemy deplets, denoted by their fading out from background. Whereas the attacker gains a hit, as shown in table.

 * Immobile bees can be counted as defendants of beehive.
*  With respective weightage of bites, the healh depletes denoted by fading away from playground.
