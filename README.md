# Swarm Attack

This simulation on swarm attack within 2 beehives, The queen is the most potent to damages, The Warrior has good attackability, The Worker is like a pawn. Bees move in the direction of their prey with random velocities. With each hit, the health of enemy deplets, denoted by their fading out from background. Whereas the attacker gains a hit, as shown in table. The simulation stays until a Queen Bee is alive, queen's death marks as loss of whole swarm. Some bees have randomly been chosen to defend their position and they are the ones who are stable at same place. The tables on the sides show live score of each swarm. Any bee with negative health, is known to be dead. The net time of engagement and falling of one of the troop is shown in the counter. One can random the start position of Bees, with the randomization button.

 * Immobile bees can be counted as defendants of beehive.
*  With respective weightage of bites, the healh depletes denoted by fading away from playground.
 * The bees seem to rotate in circle due to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroboscopic_effect#:~:text=The%20stroboscopic%20effect%20is%20a,of%20short%20or%20instantaneous%20samples." target="_blank">Stroboscopic effect</a>, more.

### Swarms are usually smaller and are accompanied by a Queen, the biggest here.
